# Claims Classification Model for TikTok

## Overview
This repository contains the project *Claims Classification Model for TikTok*, developed as part of the Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate. The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model to classify claims related to TikTok, leveraging various data analytics techniques and machine learning models. The project follows a structured six-part approach, aligning with structure of the certification.

## Repository Structure
The project is divided into six sections, each corresponding to a major learning module from the Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate. Each section contains:
- **Executive Summary**: A concise document outlining the key insights and findings from the analysis.
- **PACE Strategy Document**: A structured approach detailing the Problem, Analysis, Conclusion, and Execution strategy used.
- **Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)**: Contains Python code for data analysis, model building, and visualization, complete with documentation and comments (Sections 2–6 only).
